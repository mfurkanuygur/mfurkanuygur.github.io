                            Hello. I am M. Furkan UYGUR. I am a graduate of the Computer
                            Engineering department at Erciyes University and I am still studying
                            at the same university for my master's degree. I started to be
                            interested in web design and programming field due to various
                            courses I took during my university education. I have acquired
                            advanced HTML and CSS knowledge required to be a Frontend Developer.
                            I reached intermediate-upper level in Javascript and ReactJs through
                            the bootcamp I participated in and I continue to improve myself.
